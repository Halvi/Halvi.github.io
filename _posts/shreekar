This is a blog of a 14 year old kid interested in **mathematics,computer science, physics** and a person who loves coffee  and food .Right now i am trying to learn programming. I have a brother who is interested in startups. you can check his product right here {http://www.contactz.co}. Do download it when it is launched. It aims to disrupt the contact industry by doing every *small* thing right. I will keep you posted regularly
